ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm lftesting!

ðŸŒŸ Programmer / QA Tester / Data Analyst | Passionate About Software Quality

ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a tech enthusiast on the path to becoming a professional programmer. 
I'm currently honing my skills in Python, with a strong focus on learning and applying industry-standard tools and techniques.
My goal is to apply and refine my skills in real projects and contribute to the development of high-quality software. 
I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects where I can add value and learn alongside other professionals in the field.

ðŸŽ¯ My main areas of interest are software testing and data science.
Software Testing:
Enhance My Skills in Manual Testing: Create and execute effective test cases, identify defects, and ensure software quality.
Explore Test Automation: working with tools like Selenium, Cypress, and Postman for API testing.
By mastering these tools and methods, I aim to write reliable and efficient code that meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
Contribute to Open Source Projects: Participate in GitHub projects to apply my knowledge and learn from the community.
Obtain Certifications: Continue my education with relevant certifications such as ISTQB and other testing specializations.

ðŸ“Š Data Tools & Techniques
On the data side, I'm fascinated by how information can drive solutions and decision-making. I'm working with:
Data Analysis using libraries like pandas and NumPy
Data Visualization tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly to create compelling visual stories
Databases (SQL and NoSQL) to store, query, and manipulate data
APIs to gather and work with real-time data
Starting to explore machine learning with scikit-learn

ðŸ“š Education
ISTQB Foundation Level Certification
CS50P Introduction to programming with Python (Harvard University)
Selenium Webdriver Automation Testing [Live Projects 2024] (In progess)

ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
Python programming
Test automation with Selenium and Cypress.
Best practices in API testing.
Implementing testing in agile environments.

ðŸš€ Open to Collaboration
Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and gain new experiences. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, working on real-world applications, or collaborating on data-driven projects, I'm eager to learn and grow.
Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss anything tech-related!
